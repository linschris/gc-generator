# User Voice / Problem

Currently, as a beginner/intermediate guitar player with a lacking foundation of music theory and chord vocabulary,
I find it difficult to generate new, interesting chord pregressions as well as melodies.

It would be nice to have an application which can:
- (#1) Generate me new chords to learn and play with
    - Have descriptions of chords by describing how each note contributes to the chord's feel
        - E.g. This Cmaj7 is a chord which has a _jazzy_ feel due to the 7th note
    - Favorite, or follow
    - Nice to have: would help reinforce these chords
- (#2) What chords work well alongside? 

Goals:

Step 1 - Generates a random chord and a corresponding guitar diagram
- d3 or three-svelte?


Inspiration ideas:
- [Coolors.co](coolors.co)
    - Can generate many chords at once with mini descriptions and users can "lock" them away
